	implementations fulfilling the subset of RFC1122
	requirements needed for full host-to-host
	interoperability. Our TCP/IP implementations do not
	sacrifice any of TCP's mechanisms such as urgent
	data or congestion control. They support IP fragment
	reassembly and the number of multiple simultaneous
	connections is limited only by the available
	RAM. Despite being small and simple, our
	implementations do not require their peers to have
	complex, full-size stacks, but can communicate with
	peers running a similarly light-weight stack. The
	code size is on the order of 10 kilobytes and RAM
	usage can be configured to be as low as a few
	hundred bytes.}},
